# Tournament Scoring System

## Overview
This project is a **Tournament Scoring System**, developed as part of a college assignment. The application provides an easy-to-use interface for managing teams, individuals, and events, while also calculating scores to determine the winner.

## Features
- Add and manage **teams** and **individual players**.
- Create **events** and assign them as **team-based** or **individual-based**.
- Store and view tournament data.
- Simple and modern GUI style for ease of use.

## How It Works
1. **Teams & Players:** Add teams and assign individual players to them.
2. **Events:** Create events that teams or individuals can participate in.
3. **Scoring System:** Input results to determine which team or player performed best across multiple events.
4. **Results Display:** View stored tournament data and determine the overall winner.

## Installation
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for backend logic.
- **Tkinter (ttk)** for the graphical user interface.
- **JSON** for storing tournament data.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate scoring calculation and management system
- Add an **export feature** to save tournament results.
- Improve UI with better animations and visual elements.
